 Each Photo represent a diffrent draft during the creative process, the main goal was organization and simplicity
* The Colummns Break apart In order from earlier inbound & outbound flights to which flights left early, o time, or late.
*  Majority of flights maintain the same schedule throughout the year so the intention was to make the chart customizable for future edits
*  Each City has it's own code

******Cybersecurity Story Time******

I wanted to share the proudest moment of my Cybersecurity journey so far. About two years ago, I was working for United Airlines while studying for my first CompTIA certification. I was so enthusiastic about my studies that I told everyone how much I was looking forward to getting into the field. One day, my manager called me into his office to talk about my passion. I spent the next ten minutes excitedly explaining everything I was self-learning at the time, from simple IPconfig commands to understanding the differences between an A+ certification and a Security+ certification. That day, he recognized my eagerness and asked if I could create a tracking system for United Airlines flights. The goal was to configure a system that labeled the inbound and outbound times for each plane throughout the month and calculated a percentage for each flight based on that data. Naturally, I said I could do it in no time—maybe a month at most—to prove my knowledge. 

With creativity, determination, and some basic tools like command-line utilities and Microsoft Excel, I brought my idea to life. Although it wasn’t perfect, I was thrilled to see "Project Star" take shape. A month later, I proudly showcased it, complete with its flashy name. While it might have been a stretch to call it fully operational, the experience of building it was my pride and joy. I’ll never forget the encouragement my manager gave me that day—it pushed me to aim higher and chase my goals.
